     <h2>Why does simple recipes matter?</h2>

		 <h3>Simple recipes do perform a lot of useful functions, which is why they are the default for both bathe absolute beginner and more seasoned hands. In fact, they really do make cooking a whole lot easier. Generally, if there aren't many ingredients or steps, a beginner, or even one who perhaps doesn't have a lot of time on his hands, is more likely to have a shot at it. There really isn't too much difference to cross over to the other side. This somehow makes cooking at home generally easier for those who might otherwise feel intimidated with more demanding prospects for working in a kitchen. One other advantage that is quite significant touches on time savings. In this fast-paced life that we live, there aren't many people who could afford to spend long, languorous hours in the kitchen cooking something. Simple recipes usually give say, under half an hour to have an entire meal ready, while most often using very little preparation time. This is very welcome, especially to families or persons with tough schedules, ensuring they get to enjoy homemade food without enduring the torture of long cooking time. Easy recipes prove to have boosts toward more health-friendly lifestyles. Because there are so few ingredients to work with, it's infinitely easier to aim for unprocessed whole foods over the kinds of ingredients that are more commonly found in the complicated recipes. Thus, we may find food that is easier to prepare and also generally more healthful. Finally, these simple recipes are cheap. Fewer ingredients in a simple recipe means cheaper overall, which comes as a real relief to people looking to save money and not be wasteful. In other words, easy recipes give people the chance to cook afterward, to serve their meals in great quickness, and at really reasonable prices, with all these processes being executed almost effortlessly.</h3>
